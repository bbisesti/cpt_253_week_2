# Weekly Assignment Instructions


### Overview
This week we will learn more about advanced components - or more commonly known as "Functional components"!

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this assignment you should learn more about state, useEffect, and be able to read through other people's code and make modifications to reach the desired result!

### Instructions
1. **Review the following materials**:

   - [ReactJS Functional Components](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-functional-components/)
  
       This is a really good overview of Functional components, re-usable bits of HTML/CSS which you can use all over your website!

   - [Complete Guide to using Effects](https://blog.logrocket.com/useeffect-react-hook-complete-guide/)
  
       This webpage provides a really thorough overview of using effects in React!  These are a great way to asynchronously load data to your front-end React webpage!

   - [ReactJS Input](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/input)
  
       You will be collecting data and submitting it in this assignment!  Please be sure to read up on how to collect input and call the "submit" button.
      
3. **Complete the following tasks**:

   For this assignment you will need to collect a "passkey" from the API your ReactJS application is pointing to and feed it BACK to the API with your username and class code!  Fetching/Pushing the data from/to the API is all set up for you!  But you are missing inputs for the passkey and class code fields - what do you do?!

   Please read the above, then update the "SubmitPassKeyForm.jsx" to give yourself the additional two inputs you'll need.  Once you have added the fields please copy/paste the passkey in as well as enter your CPT username (i.e. for "Brett Bisesti" I'd enter  "bbisesti") and your class "CPT253".  Press submit, and wait for the alert to tell you that you've succeeded!

   One note I'd like to also make is the "Console" in your broswer will ABSOLUTELY be your friend from here on out!  If you dont know how to get to it please right-click anywhere on a web page in your broswer and click "inspect". 

   The "Console" tab will show you "console.log" or error messages and the network" tab will be useful for seeing network data!  The other tabs are useful too so take some time to get oriented with them!

   If done correctly when you press the "submit" button you'll see an alert saying you succeeded!  If not you will see an alert saying "try again"
   
5. **Please commit your code to a public GitHub repository**
    - Once you have completed all three tasks in your code please commit your updated python code to a public repository in GitHub!
    - Once you have a public repository link submit that link to the week one assignment in Brightspace!
